    <p>For fifteen years I&rsquo;ve been planning, designing and building digital products for an eclectic range of clients in the technology, energy, financial, retail and entertainment sectors. From multi-channel strategies to production-ready front-end code, my hybrid skills as a designer and developer ensure there&rsquo;s never a dull day.</p>

    <p>I have an insatiable curiosity and am passionate about the outdoors, space travel, music, philosophy, agile processes, and the intersection of design and engineering. Outside of work I enjoy the outdoor pursuits of snowboarding, kiteboarding, camping, hiking and running, and the indoor joys of writing, reading, coding and homebrewing.</p>

    <p>In my journey I&rsquo;ve worked as a wilderness guide, snowboard instructor, camp counselor, windsurfing director, envelope stuffer, standardized test grader, shipping manager, pizza thrower, humor writer, arts reporter, jazz musician and barista. I worked as a professional web developer for over five years and was the lone gun behind Brainside Out, a tiny web design shop.</p>

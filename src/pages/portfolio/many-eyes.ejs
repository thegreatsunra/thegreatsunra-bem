    <p>IBMâ€™s Many Eyes website allows people to upload and visualize data, and facilitates social interaction and analysis by allowing people to openly share these visualizations.</p>
    <p>In order to test the ease of learning of the Many Eyes website, we conducted a series of formal usability evaluations with three graduate students at Indiana University.  Based on our analysis of the usability data, we concluded that the Many Eyes website is somewhat difficult to learn; however, once the users have made it through the registration process and explored the features of the site, they find it fairly easy to use.</p>
    <p>We recommend improving the Many Eyes registration and login process, so that field requirements are clear and error messages are more specific and helpful. We also recommend modifying the layout of some page elements so that relevant options are more logically grouped and visible.</p>

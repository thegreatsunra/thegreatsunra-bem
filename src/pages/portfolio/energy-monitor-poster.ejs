<h3 class="c-page-title--small c-page-title@lg">In advancing to the second round of the 2009 CHI Student Design Competition, we designed a poster describing our concept for a home electricity monitoring system. After traveling to Boston for the conference and sharing our poster, our team was selected to move onto the final round, where we presented our design and placed fourth overall in the competition.</h3>

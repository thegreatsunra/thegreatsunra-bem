<h3 class="c-page-title--small c-page-title@lg">Together with Jake Ingman, we built a web-based iPhone application to help our dear friend Mark Bixby keep an eye on his ticker during SXSW 2008. By choosing to feed him bacon or juice, the crowd had control over Mark’s delicious fate.</h3>

    <p>Jake Ingman and I brainstormed furiously during the creation of Bixby Heart, jamming on each others' ideas while coming up with our final design direction. Jake Ingman did the graphic design, and I wired up the entire application in PHP and MySQL. After accidentally destroying all the code I had written over the previous three months, I rebuilt the entire application in CodeIgniter the evening before leaving for SXSW. We experimented with using the Flickr API, Twitter API and Google Charts API, and while everything didn't make it into the final launch, it was a wild ride and a smash hit at SXSW 2008!</p>

<h3 class="c-page-title--small c-page-title@lg">We propose a cruise ship that uniquely caters to the people who typically go on cruises; namely, those who have faded Harley Davidson t-shirts, wear fanny packs, and have a favorite monster truck driver. Christened “Dane and James’ Lost Dreams” this queen of the seas would feature a roller coaster, an entire deck of mini-fridges and microwaves, and luxurious double-wide toilet paper.</h3>

    <h3>Is my handwriting blowing your mind? Allow me to translate:</h3>
    <p>“Dane and James’ Lost Dreams!”</p>
    <p>Cruise Ship + Roller Coaster = <em>Awesome.</em></p>
    <p>Smoke (cruise ship also makes <em>dirt bike</em> sounds) BRAAP-BRAAP!</p>
    <p>PROBLEM: No one is signing up for spring break in Cancun for 2010… some say it’s too early, but those people are <em>wrong</em> (and probably stupid, too). We say it’s because of SWINE FLU (aka H1N1, for that <em>bitchy</em> pig lobby).</p>
    <p>…just means more <em>bacon</em> for the rest of us.</p>
    <p>SOLUTION: “Dane and James’ Lost Dreams,” a cruise ship that caters to the <em>real</em> target user group of cruise ships!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      People who own Harley Davidson t-shirts (but no longer have the <em>sleeves</em> to go along with them) – used to be black, but went through the wash too many times…</li>
      <li>People with fanny packs (preferably in bright colors).</li>
      <li>People who have a <em>favorite</em> monster truck driver.</li>
      <li>People with multiple chins.</li>
      <li>People who shouldn’t wear swimsuits, nor <em>own</em> them.</li>
      <li>People who live in <em>dorms</em>, or still <em>wish</em> they did.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FUCK THE CASINO. We’re doing an <em>entire deck</em> of mini-fridges and microwaves and TV dinners. (not to mention TV <em>desserts!</em>)</p>
    <p>VODKA + JELLO CAKE = <em>VODELLO CAKE</em></p>
    <p>Luxurious Double-Wide Toilet Paper<br>
    America <em>demands</em> Brawny on its ass.</p>
